# Talking To AI: Building AI Agents with a Voice

In this engaging and interactive 90-to-120 minute workshop, we delve into the world of Conversational AI, focusing on the creation and utilization of AI Agents. These Agents, equipped with the power of OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and/or Hugging Face's FalconInstruct7B models, are designed to manage dialogue flows, providing a more human-like interaction with AI.

## Workshop Highlights

- **Understanding AI Agents**: We demystify the concept of AI Agents, entities designed to handle diverse interactions, perform actions, and deliver dynamic responses across different contexts. These Agents, with their unique names, personalities, and goals, bring a human-like presentation to the table, making them effective dialogue partners.

- **Hands-on Learning**: Participants will get their hands dirty by building their own AI Agents. We'll guide you through the process of setting up the environment, acquiring API keys, and installing necessary libraries. 

- **Interactive Dialogue Management**: Learn how to manage dialogue flow with AI Agents. We'll teach you how to equip your Agent with specific attributes and how to use underlying AI models for generating responses.

- **Fun Conversations**: The fun part? You get to define your Agent's personality! Want a sarcastic AI? You got it! How about a permanently bothered one? Absolutely! Or perhaps you'd like an AI that's relentlessly positive and cheerful? Sure! The goal is to create fun and engaging conversations with your AI Agent.

- **Audio Integration**: We'll take it a step further by adding voice interaction capabilities to our Agents. This enhances the interaction experience and expands the environments where our Agents can operate, in addition to demonstrating what an 'Integration' means in the context of AI Agents.

- **Leveraging Colab**: To make this workshop as accessible as possible, all you need is the notebook found in this repository. By using Google Colab, you can easily follow along with the workshop activities. Not only does Colab provide a user-friendly interface, but it also offers free access to computational resources, including GPUs. This means you can focus on learning and building, without worrying about the computational demands of the AI models.

## Deep Dive into AI Agents

AI Agents are at the heart of this session. They are not just a tool, but a paradigm shift in how we interact with AI. In this workshop we will get a good understanding of what they actually _are_, how to build them and the core concept of 'Integrations' in this context.

## Workshop Structure

There will be three main parts: a presentation to introduce the concepts and tools, the core hands-on session where participants will get to build and interact with their own AI Agents, and a fun Kahoot to wrap up the workshop and consolidate the learning.

## Who Should Attend?

This workshop is oriented towards intermediate learners. However, beginners may find it funny and inspirational, while advanced professionals may get a better understanding of brand-new concepts like AI Agents. Familiarity with Python and HuggingFace is nice to have, but not needed at all - the notebook guides all workshop path.

By the end of the session, you'll have a comprehensive understanding of Conversational AI, AI Agents, and how to build and interact with them. So, are you ready to create your own AI Agent and dive into some fun conversations?
